### Welcome, i'm IanaÃ«l !

I'm currently a computer science student at 42 Paris.
There, we're asked to develop a large variety of programs, you'll find the most interesting ones in repositories starting with "42"!

On the personal side, I'm mostly interested in low level languages like C, C++ and Zig, and my main domain of interest is game development.
I'm working on my first (small) game "Suzy's graveyard" with SFML, but i hope to build my own game engine from scratch soon !
