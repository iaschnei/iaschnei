### Welcome, i'm IanaÃ«l !

I'm currently a computer science student at 42 Paris.
There, we're asked to develop a large variety of programs, you'll find the most interesting ones in repositories starting with "42"!

On the personal side, I'm mostly interested in low level languages like C, C++, Zig and Rust (even though I barely scratched the last two).
I'm working on a GB/GBC/GBA emulator right now !
