### Hey there, i'm IanaÃ«l !

Currently a computer science student at 42 Paris, I specialise in low level development and cybersecurity.

You'll find school projects such as a homemade kernel, CTF-like challenges or a web server. I also put there some personal projects : emulators for the chip-8 and (Work in progress) for the GameBoy/GameBoy Color !

You can reach out to me at [ianael.pro@proton.me](mailto:ianael.pro@proton.me)
