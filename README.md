### Hey there, i'm IanaÃ«l !

Currently a computer science student at 42 Paris, I specialise in software development and cybersecurity.

You'll find school projects such as a homemade kernel, CTF-like challenges or a web server. I also put there some personal projects such as and emulator for the chip-8.
